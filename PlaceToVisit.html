It was a kingdom of great wealth and sophistication, controlling the caravan routes from the hinterland of Africa trading with ivory and slaves. Its kings minted gold coinage when almost no one else in the world was rich enough to afford it or sophisticated enough to require it.

                  The scenic Awash National Park is located less than 200 km east of Addis Ababa and covers 750 square kilometer acacia and grassland savanna. It has a beautiful gorge carved by the Awash River and a huge waterfall where the river plunged into the gorge. The Filwuha 'hot springs' with the surrounding doum palm offers an oasis like setting. A quick dip in the hot water is possible. The dormant Fantelle volcano is another distinct feature of the park.</p>
